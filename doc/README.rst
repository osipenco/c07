Pseudo-module SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The pseudo-module SYSTEM contains low-level and unsafe procedures,
| errors in using procedures of the pseudo-module SYSTEM can lead to
| corruption of run-time data and abnormal termination of the program.

::

   PROCEDURE ADR(v: any type): INTEGER
           v is a variable or procedure;
           returns the address of v

   PROCEDURE SADR(x: string constant (CHAR UTF-8)): INTEGER
           returns the address of x

   PROCEDURE WSADR(x: string constant (WCHAR)): INTEGER
           returns the address of x

   PROCEDURE VAL(T; v: any type): T
           v is a variable;
           interprets v as a variable of type T

   PROCEDURE SIZE(T): INTEGER
           returns the size of type T

   PROCEDURE TYPEID(T): INTEGER
           T is a record type or pointer type,
           returns the number of the type in the table of record types

   PROCEDURE INF(): REAL
           returns the special real value "infinity"

   PROCEDURE MOVE(Source, Dest, n: INTEGER)
           Copies n bytes of memory from Source to Dest,
           Source and Dest cannot overlap

   PROCEDURE GET(a: INTEGER; VAR v: any basic type, PROCEDURE, POINTER)
           v := Memory[a]

   PROCEDURE GET8(a: INTEGER; VAR x: INTEGER, SET, BYTE, CHAR, WCHAR, SYSTEM.CARD32)
           Equivalent to SYSTEM.MOVE(a, SYSTEM.ADR(x), 1)

   PROCEDURE GET16(a: INTEGER; VAR x: INTEGER, SET, WCHAR, SYSTEM.CARD32)
           Equivalent to SYSTEM.MOVE(a, SYSTEM.ADR(x), 2)

   PROCEDURE GET32(a: INTEGER; VAR x: INTEGER, SET, SYSTEM.CARD32)
           Equivalent to SYSTEM.MOVE(a, SYSTEM.ADR(x), 4)

   PROCEDURE PUT(a: INTEGER; x: any basic type, PROCEDURE, POINTER)
           Memory[a] := x;
           If x: BYTE or x: WCHAR, then the value of x will be extended
           to 64 bits, to write bytes use SYSTEM.PUT8,
           for WCHAR -- SYSTEM.PUT16

   PROCEDURE PUT8(a: INTEGER; x: INTEGER, SET, BYTE, CHAR, WCHAR, SYSTEM.CARD32)
           Memory[a] := lower 8 bits (x)

   PROCEDURE PUT16(a: INTEGER; x: INTEGER, SET, BYTE, CHAR, WCHAR, SYSTEM.CARD32)
           Memory[a] := lower 16 bits (x)

   PROCEDURE PUT32(a: INTEGER; x: INTEGER, SET, BYTE, CHAR, WCHAR, SYSTEM.CARD32)
           Memory[a] := lower 32 bits (x)

   PROCEDURE COPY(VAR Source: any type; VAR Dest: any type; n: INTEGER)
           Copies n bytes of memory from Source to Dest.
           Equivalent to SYSTEM.MOVE(SYSTEM.ADR(Source), SYSTEM.ADR(Dest), n)

   PROCEDURE CODE(byte1, byte2,... : BYTE)
           Inserting machine code,
           byte1, byte2 ... - constants in the range 0..255,
           for example: SYSTEM.CODE(048H,08BH,045H,010H) (* mov rax,qword[rbp+16] *)

| Also, the SYSTEM module defines the CARD32 type (**4** bytes).
| No explicit operations are allowed for the CARD32 type, except for
  assignment.

The functions of the SYSTEM pseudo-module cannot be used in constant
expressions.

System flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| When declaring procedural types and global procedures, a calling
  convention flag
| may be specified after the PROCEDURE keyword: ``[systemv]``,
  ``[linux]``, ``[oberon]``, ``[ccall]``.

For example:

::

   PROCEDURE [oberon] MyProc (x, y, z: INTEGER): INTEGER;

| The ``[linux]`` flag is a synonym for ``[systemv]``. The ``[ccall]``
  flag is a synonym for ``[systemv]``.
| A dash after the flag name (``[linux-]``) means that the procedure
  result
| may be ignored (not allowed for the REAL type). If the flag is not
  specified
| or the ``[oberon]`` flag is specified, the internal calling convention
  is assumed.
| ``[systemv]`` is used for communication with the operating system and
  external applications.

| When declaring record types, the ``[noalign]`` flag can be specified
  after the RECORD keyword.
| The ``[noalign]`` flag means no alignment of the record fields.
| Records with the system flag cannot have a base type and cannot be the
  base type of other records.

You must import SYSTEM to use system flags.

CASE statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CASE statement syntax:

::

   CaseStatement =
           CASE Expression OF Case {"|" Case}
                   [ELSE StatementSequence] END.
   Case = [CaseLabelList ":" StatementSequence].
   CaseLabelList = CaseLabels {"," CaseLabels}.
   CaseLabels = ConstExpression [".." ConstExpression].

For example:

::

   CASE x OF
   |-1:    DoSomething1
   | 1:    DoSomething2
   | 0:    DoSomething3
   ELSE
           DoSomething4
   END

| Constant expressions can be used in variant labels, the ELSE branch is
  optional.
| If the value of x does not correspond to any variant and ELSE is
  missing, the program
| terminates with a run-time error.

WCHAR Type
~~~~~~~~~~

| The WCHAR type has been added to the language for convenient Unicode
  support.
| For WCHAR and ARRAY OF WCHAR types, all the same operations are
  allowed as for CHAR and
| ARRAY OF CHAR types, with the exception of the built-in CHR procedure,
  which
| returns only the CHAR type. To obtain a value of the WCHAR type,
| you should use the WCHR procedure instead of CHR. To work correctly
  with the type,
| you must save the source code in UTF-8 encoding with BOM.

Concatenation of string and character constants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Concatenation of constant strings and CHAR characters is allowed:

::

   str = CHR(39) + "string" + CHR(39); (* str = "'string'" *)

   newline = 0DX + 0AX;

Null pointer type check and guard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The original language announcement does not define the programâ€™s
  behavior when
| guarding p(T) and checking the type of p IS T when p = NIL.
| In many Oberon implementations, performing such an operation results
  in a runtime error.
| In this implementation, the null pointer type guard does not result in
  an error,
| and the type check yields FALSE. In some cases, this allows to
  significantly
| reduce the frequency of using type guards.

Additional Standard Procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   DISPOSE (VAR v: any_pointer)
           Frees the memory allocated by the NEW procedure for the
           dynamic variable v^, and assigns NIL to the variable v.

   COPY (x: ARRAY OF CHAR/WCHAR; VAR v: ARRAY OF CHAR/WCHAR);
           v := x;
           If LEN(v) < LEN(x), then the string x will not be copied completely

   LSR (x, n: INTEGER): INTEGER
           Logical shift of x n bits to the right.

   MIN (a, b: INTEGER): INTEGER
           Minimum of two values.

   MAX (a, b: INTEGER): INTEGER
           Maximum of two values.

   BITS (x: INTEGER): SET
           Interprets x as a value of type SET.
           Executed at compile time.

   LENGTH (s: ARRAY OF CHAR/WCHAR): INTEGER
           Length of 0X-terminated string s, excluding the 0X character.
           If the 0X character is missing, the function returns the length
           of array s. s cannot be a constant.

   WCHR (n: INTEGER): WCHAR
           Type conversion similar to CHR(n: INTEGER): CHAR

Importing modules with path and file name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Examples:

::

   IMPORT Math IN "./lib/math.ob07"; (* relative to the current module *)

   IMPORT M1 IN "C:\lib\math.ob07"; (* absolute path *)

Hidden parameters of procedures
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Some procedures may have hidden parameters, they are not in the list
  of
| formal parameters, but are taken into account by the compiler
| when translating calls. This is possible in the following cases:

1. The procedure has a formal parameter open array:

::

   PROCEDURE Proc (x: ARRAY OF ARRAY OF REAL);
           The call is translated as follows:
           Proc(LEN(x), LEN(x[0]), SYSTEM.ADR(x))

2. The procedure has a formal parameter-variable of type RECORD:

::

   PROCEDURE Proc (VAR x: Rec);
           The call is translated as follows:
           Proc(SYSTEM.TYPEID(Rec), SYSTEM.ADR(x))

Hidden parameters must be taken into account when communicating with
external applications.

RTL Module
~~~~~~~~~~

| All programs implicitly use the RTL module. The compiler translates
| some operations (type checking and guarding, string comparison,
  run-time
| error messages, etc.) as calls to procedures in this module.
| You should not call these procedures explicitly.
| Run-time error messages are printed to the terminal (Linux).

API Module
~~~~~~~~~~

| Like the RTL module, the API module is not intended for direct use.
| It provides communication between the RTL and the OS.

Generating DLL executables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| Only procedures can be exported. To do this, the procedure must
| be in the main module of the program, its name must be marked with the
| export symbol, and the calling convention must be specified. You
  cannot
| export procedures that are imported from other DLLs.
